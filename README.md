# Java CoinInn API

#
coininn-java-api is a lightweight Java library for interacting with the [CoinInn API](https://www.coininn.com), providing complete API coverage, as well as event streaming using WebSockets.


Alternatively, you can clone this repository and run the [examples](https://github.com/coininn-exchange/coininn-java-api).

## Examples

### Getting Started
There are three main client classes that can be used to interact with the API:

1. [`CoinInnApiResultClient`](https://github.com/coininn-exchange/coininn-java-api/blob/master/src/test/java/com/coininn/api/CoinInnApiResultClient.java);
2. [`CoinInnWsApiResultClient`](https://github.com/coininn-exchange/coininn-java-api/blob/master/src/test/java/com/coininn/api/CoinInnWsApiResultClient.java);
